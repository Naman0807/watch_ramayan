                <li class="mb-4">
                    <strong class="text-black">Birth:</strong>
                    Lord Ram, the embodiment of righteousness, took his first breath in the sacred city of Ayodhya. His
                    arrival,
                    celebrated annually as Ram Navami, filled the kingdom with divine radiance, bringing joy and
                    prosperity to
                    all.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-4">
                    <strong class="text-black">Marriage:</strong>
                    In the illustrious Swayamvar ceremony, Lord Ram showcased his strength and devotion by lifting Lord
                    Shiva's
                    divine bow, earning the hand of Sita. Their union symbolizes the eternal bond of love and virtue.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-4">
                    <strong class="text-black">Exile:</strong>
                    The profound commitment to honor his father's promise led Ram into the enchanting forests. For 14
                    years, he
                    embraced simplicity, learned from sages, and connected with nature, exemplifying humility and
                    resilience.

                <li class="mb-4">
                    <strong class="text-black">Abduction of Sita:</strong>
                    The dark clouds of destiny cast their shadows as the demon king Ravana abducted Sita. The ensuing
                    struggle
                    epitomizes the eternal battle between good and evil, righteousness, and deception.

                <li class="mb-4">
                    <strong class="text-black">Victory over Ravana:</strong>
                    The battle of Lanka witnessed the triumph of righteousness as Lord Ram, with unwavering
                    determination and
                    divine guidance, vanquished the mighty Ravana, rescuing Sita and restoring dharma.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-4">
                    <strong class="text-black">Return to Ayodhya:</strong>
                    Ayodhya, once shrouded in darkness, radiated with the joyous return of Lord Ram. The heartwarming
                    welcome by
                    his loyal subjects marked the beginning of the golden era, a testament to the victory of light over
                    darkness.

                <li class="mb-4">
                    <strong class="text-black">Banishment of Sita:</strong>
                    In the face of societal doubts, Lord Ram reluctantly made the painful decision to banish Sita. This
                    heart-wrenching moment reflects the challenges faced by those devoted to duty and honor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-black">Departure from Earth:</strong>
                    Lord Ram's divine journey on Earth concluded as he returned to his celestial abode. His teachings,
                    embedded in
                    the hearts of his devotees, continue to inspire and guide humanity towards righteousness and
                    compassion.
